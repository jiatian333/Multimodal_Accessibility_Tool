Stationary Geospatial Data Cache

This module provides the `StationaryData` class, responsible for one-time loading
and in-memory caching of static spatial datasets used throughout isochrone computations.

Location:
---------
- app.core.cache

Responsibilities:
-----------------
- Set up coordinate reference systems and transformations (WGS84 â†” Swiss LV95).
- Load and merge urban/cantonal boundaries from OSM.
- Download and combine water and river features to define unwalkable areas.
- Retrieve graphs (walk, bike, drive) and save to disk for caching.
- Load public transport station metadata and build an R-tree index.

Key Components:
---------------
- `StationaryData`: Singleton-style class that prevents redundant geodata downloads.
- `load()`: Entry point for loading all geospatial assets if not already loaded.
- `_load_*()`: Private helpers for CRS, geometry, graph, and station loading.

Usage:
------
Typical use pattern in the application:

    from app.core.cache import stationary_data
    stationary_data.load()
    G = stationary_data.G_canton
    stations = stationary_data.public_transport_stations

Dependencies:
-------------
- `osmnx`, `networkx`, `pyproj`, `shapely`, `rtree`, `pandas`, `tqdm`
